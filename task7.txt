What did I learn?
    I learnt a little about fileio the c way.

What was difficult?
    I didn't find anything particulary difficult.

How can the lab be improved?
    Move some things from lab2 to lab3 beacuse 
    lab2 had to much and a lot of new things that
    we didn't cover in the lectures. On the other
    hand half of lab3 was copy and modify things from
    lab2 and the other half was short and easy.

I spent about 3-5 hours on this lab.
